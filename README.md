# Automation Final Project
Hello,

My name is **Moran Treibochan**, and this is my **automation final  project**.

I made this project to implement my automation skills that I acquire in the "Full stack automation tester" course I was did. (`By Yoni Flenner`)

The project infrastructure was created from scratch.

This project was made on the "Avaza" platform: https://www.avaza.com/

Avaza is a project management platform, which you can create projects and add tasks, create team and assign them tasks.

In this project I was tested this platform in 3 ways: Web, Mobile & API.

Each platform has it's own tests flows, and test cases.

Basically, I made 2 projects: Weather, Chuck Norris Jokes.
In each the automation creating 1 new Weather task, and 1 Chuck Norris task.

The Weather task contain the correct weather information in my hometown (Rishon LeZion).
This information I'm taking from "https://openweathermap.org/" API in "get" request.

The Chuck Norris task contain joke about Chuck Norris.
This joke I'm taking randomly from "https://api.chucknorris.io/" API in "get" request.

The logging credentials are stored in Date Base, by https://remotemysql.com/
which i get with mySQL query to get them from the DB.
